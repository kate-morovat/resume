 <h4>Software Designer and Developer: University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (2013 - 2017)</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Modified and maintained methods as well as developed new web-based and windows-based features and methods of the biology websites. This software application reads genomic data from BLAST database, applied multiple functions, and presented on the website. The software application was written in Python, Java (used multithread programming to read data from BLAST database and save on the local server faster and used Junit for unit testing as well), PHP, JavaScript, JSON, and MySQL. </li>
  <li>Used Reverse engineering technique to rewrite the web-based software application for Human Resources (HR) in PHP (used MVC design pattern), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MS SQL Server 2012. Also, maintained the original application and modified methods as well. Modified and developed forms and reports of the windows-based application, which saved and generated reports of W2 forms in VBA and Ms Access for Human Resources Department (HR).</li> 
  <li>Designed and developed websites in SharePoint 2013 for Graduate School & International Education Department (GSIE). Implemented workflow with REST API and JavaScript to edit the core of SharePoint and create templates in SharePoint. These templates were used by other departments to develop their web sites.</li>
  <li>Used Scrum to manage the projects at Graduate School & International Education Department GSIE and designed project charter, business requirements, risk plan, communication plan, and tasks plan for projects.</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Research Experience: Designing Secure Access Control Model in Social Network on Cloud (2013 - 2017)</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>This project, which was the topic of my dissertation, was focused on developing confidential data access in social networks.</li>
  <li>Designed a model to empower people to define access control policies in English language to control the access to their belongings shared on the social networks. Save data in Neo4j database.</li>
  <li>Designed and developed software in Python, NLTK library, to transform those policies to a format which can be processed by computer. Designed and developed a software application in Python for accepting or rejecting a request generated by another user, who wishes to access resources.</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Data Modeler-Database Designer/Developer: Security Exchange and Technology Management (2010 - 2012)</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Used Scrum methodology to Manage the project, called Portfolio Management Authorization (PMA). This project helped Tehran Stock Exchange Co. (TSE) to accept or reject all requests generated by Brokerage firms who need to receive permission to manage investor’s portfolio.</li>  
  <li>In PMA project, collected stakeholder requirements, defined vision document and short storied document, which defined all clients’ requirements, functions, and activities as well. Used UML to present client’s requirements in diagrams such as use cases, class, state, activity, sequence, and communication diagrams. These documents and short stories documents helped designers and developers to generate codes. In PMA project, defined all entities and relationships among them and presented in e-r model using ER studio, after applying normalization through the 3rd normalization, designed and developed database and tables, tuned performance, designed and developed triggers and defined constraints to insure data consistency and integrity in MS SQL server 2008.
